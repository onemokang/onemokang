### 👋 Hey, I'm Onemo!

I recently graduated from Boston College with a degree in Physics, Mathematics, and Philosophy, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Capital One. I am actively seeking opportunities to work on personal projects and engage in collaborative endeavors here.

- 👨‍🎓 I successfully completed [Capital One Developer Academy (CODA)](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/culture/coda-making-tech-move/), a six-month intensive software engineering training program designed to equip non-Computer Science majors for professional roles as software engineers
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on projects involving JS, HTML, and CSS
